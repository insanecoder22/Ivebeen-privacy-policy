    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: 15-11-2025</p>
    <p>Thank you for using I've been! This Privacy Policy explains how your data is collected, used, and protected when you use the app.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>I've been collects only the information necessary for core app functionality. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your email address (if you create an account)</li>
      <li>Your list of visited countries</li>
      <li>Optional settings such as theme preferences</li>
      <li>Optional icons/tags added to countries</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How Data Is Stored</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored in two places:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>On your device – visited countries, settings, achievements (local storage)</li>
      <li>In Firebase Cloud Firestore – your saved countries, achievements, and premium status are synced so you can access them on any device. All cloud data is stored on Firestore servers located in Europe.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>We use your data <span class="bold">only</span> for saving and syncing visited countries, managing achievements, enabling premium features, and providing basic app functionality.</p>
    <p>We <span class="bold">do NOT</span> sell your data, share it with third parties (other than Firebase services used to operate the app), or use it for advertising.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>I've been uses Firebase, a service provided by Google LLC, for authentication (logging in) and Cloud Firestore (saving data). Firebase may collect device information and other diagnostics as described in their own 
      <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We rely on Firebase’s built-in security features to protect your data. We do not store any passwords—authentication is handled entirely by Firebase.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Data Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to request deletion of your account and all stored data. You can do this from the Settings screen inside the app.</p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>I've been is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children under this age.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. When changes are made, you may be prompted to accept the updated version.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact</h2>
